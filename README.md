Conspicuous-Molyjam2013
=======================

My team's game completed over 2 days during Molyjam 2013.

It can be played here: http://www.kongregate.com/games/zblade495/conspicuous

It's about as down and dirty as you can possibly get. Which means pretty dirty. But, we're proud of what we created in such a short amount of time.

The 2 days in which we worked included:

1. building prototypes in 2-person teams
2. forming larger teams
3. scoping the project
4. designing, programming, writing, creating audio and drawing

We worked from 9am to midnight at the Dutch Game Garden in Utrecht, Netherlands.

The team was:

* Nick Witsel: Designer
* Marijn van Putten: Artist
* Aida de Ridder: Artist
* Shawn McCool: Programmer

I really enjoyed working with them all.

The game was built using Photoshop, Audacity, Google Docs and Intellij Idea. It was programmed in Haxe using the HaxePunk game development framework. Molyjam was the first time that I used Haxe.
